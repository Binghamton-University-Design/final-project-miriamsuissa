                  <p>In my life, and as many others have, I set certain  or stages or chapters in my life that "built my home" up until this point and of course, it is still not complete. However, I am excited to see what is in store for me, a potential family for myself, and a career in architecture or Graphic design. Something that I have realized is that regardless of what I decide now or have figured out up unil this point, everything is subject to change and there is always room for growth and new oppertunities!</p>
